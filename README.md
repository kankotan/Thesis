# Thesis
Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks<br>
<br><br>
This project is a thesis study conducted in the Physics Department of Yildiz Technical University. It aims to classify military vehicles in the MSTAR dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
<br><br>
About the Project
 In this study, classification of SAR (Synthetic-Aperture Radar) images created within the scope of the MSTAR (Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition) program was performed using three different CNN architectures (AlexNet, VGG-16, and ResNet).
